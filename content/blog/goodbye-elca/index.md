Dear my brothers, sisters, and fens,

Today is my last working day after almost 7 years at ELCA.

But our lives aren't just measured in years. They're measured in the lives of people we touch around us.

Yes, I know, that is a quote 😝. But still, all you guys are part of my youth literally. Thank you for everything!

Live long and prosper 🖖

Dung Ho.

Quite a ride, huh!? 😄
